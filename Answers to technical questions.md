### Technical Test Responses

- **How much time did you spend on this task?**  
  Approximately 5 hours.

- **If you had more time, what improvements or additions would you make?**  
  Since OpenWeatherMap updates its data every 10 minutes, I would implement a caching mechanism to store request data for 10 minutes to reduce the number of API calls.

- **What is the most useful feature recently added to your favorite programming language?**  
  I used `AsyncLocal` and `ThreadLocal` in C# to store data in a thread-safe manner. Below is a code snippet demonstrating their use:

```csharp
public static class OperationContext
{
    private static readonly AsyncLocal<string> _methodName = new AsyncLocal<string>();
    private static readonly AsyncLocal<string> _description = new AsyncLocal<string>();

    public static string CurrentMethodName
    {
        get => _methodName.Value;
        set => _methodName.Value = value;
    }

    public static string Description
    {
        get => _description.Value;
        set => _description.Value = value;
    }
}

public class HubFilter : IHubFilter
{
    public async ValueTask<object> InvokeMethodAsync(
        HubInvocationContext invocationContext,
        Func<HubInvocationContext, ValueTask<object>> next)
    {
        try
        {
            var methodName = invocationContext.HubMethodName;
            var methodInfo = invocationContext.Hub.GetType().GetMethod(methodName);
            var descriptionAttribute = methodInfo?.GetCustomAttributes(typeof(DescriptionAttribute), false)
                .FirstOrDefault() as DescriptionAttribute;
            string description = descriptionAttribute?.Description;
            OperationContext.CurrentMethodName = methodName;
            OperationContext.Description = description;
            var result = await next(invocationContext);
            return result;
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Exception calling {invocationContext.HubMethodName}: {ex.Message}");
            throw;
        }
    }
}
```

- **How do you identify and diagnose a performance issue in a production environment? Have you done this before?**
I use Application Insights to monitor application performance, focusing on slow requests and exceptions in logs. Additionally, I leverage tools like Elasticsearch for log analysis and Query Store to identify time-consuming SQL queries. Yes, I have performed these diagnostics in production environments.

- **What’s the last technical book you read or technical conference you attended? What did you learn from it?**
I recently listened to the "Software Engineering Daily" podcast. Key takeaways include the importance of selecting appropriate data structures and design patterns for specific problems to optimize performance and maintainability.

- **What’s your opinion about this technical test?**
The test is well-designed, covering a broad range of technical and soft skills. It strikes a good balance between difficulty and accessibility, making it both challenging and fair.
